# iProov Android Demo App

This is an demo Android application that integrates the **iProov's Android SDK** for Genuine Presence Assurance. The app demonstrates user enrollment and authentication using iProov's facial recognition technology.

## üìå Features
- **GPA Onboarding Experience** with iProov.
- **Custom UI Enhancements**, adopted a few UX customisation.
- **Retry Mechanism** for failed scans.
- **Security Best Practices** to protect the API keys.


## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** (Latest version recommended)
- **Android SDK 26+** (Minimum)
- **Gradle 7+**
- **API Key & Secret** from iProov

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this Repository


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure API Credentials Securely
To prevent exposing API keys in your repository, store them in local.properties instead of hardcoding them in the source code.

**Step 1**: Add API Keys to `local.properties`, open local.properties (located in the project root) and add:

```bash
iproovApiKey=your_api_key_here
iproovApiSecret=your_secret_here
```

**Step 2**: The API Keys will be loaded in `Constants.kt`, and you can set the baseUrl for iProov APIClient:
```kt
const val BASE_URL = "wss://<region>.rp.secure.iproov.me/ws"
const val FUEL_URL = "https://<region>.rp.secure.iproov.me/api/v2/"
```

**Step 3**: Make sure `local.properties` is in `.gitignore`.


#### üîí Why Use local.properties? 
‚úÖ Prevents API key leaks in public repositories.

‚úÖ Avoids hardcoding sensitive data in source code.

‚úÖ Keeps credentials out of version control (local.properties is ignored by .gitignore by default).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Run the App
**Via Android Studio:**

1. Create a virtual device - i.e. Pixel 9 Pro XL in Android Studio, or connect to an android device (Android 8 minimum).
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle files (File > Sync Project with Gradle).
4. Run the app (Shift + F10 or click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) on the device.
5. Enter the user name to start the onboarding:

6. Tap continue to kick off the face scanning:

## üîó Client References

### üëÄ Observation

* IProov Tokens must be securely generated server-side and validated before granting access.
On-device token generation is insecure (should be avoided in production).
* API rate limits and performance optimizations must be considered.


### üöß Implementation Decision:
‚úÖ The backend must implement an device authentication service to securely generate and validate iProov tokens.

‚úÖ Avoid storing raw biometric data‚Äîonly store anonymized metadata and verification results.

‚úÖ Ensure regional compliance by using data residency options (e.g., hosting in EU for GDPR compliance).


### ‚ùì Questions for the Customer‚Äôs Architecture Decisions

* How will you handle the API rate limits if your application scales up?
* Are you implementing logging and monitoring for iProov session status and errors?
* will you customise the iProov's UI experience (colors, branding) to match your app's design?
* How do you ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, or other biometric data regulations?
